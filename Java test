This solution can be acheived easily by using Linear Time Complexity

Suppose we have to find square root of 9,
1*1=1
2*2=2
3*3=9

Code will be
class Solution {

public int mysqrt(int x)  {

if (x < 2) return x;

int end = x / 2;

int start = 1;

while (start <= end) {
      int mid = (start + end)/2;
      if ((long)mid*mid > x) {
         end = mid-1 ;
         } else {
         start = mid + 1;
         }
   }
   return end;
   }
